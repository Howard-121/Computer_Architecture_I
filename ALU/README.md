Procedure:

Lab 1 consists of two tasks. 
The first task is to create a 16*32 register file by using SystemVerilog on Quartus. 
The second task is to build an ALU that performs addition, subtraction, AND, OR operations, along with a 4-bit ALUFlags output to show overflow, carry out, zero, or a negative result. 
Finally, I simulate both circuits on ModelSim and verify the output signals.


Task #2

The ALU I create is a combinational circuit with two 32-bit input values, one 2-bit control signal, one 32-bit output value, and one 4-bit ALUFlags, as seen in Figure 1.

When the two input values, a and b, are sent into the ALU, ALU will compute every operation (addition, subtraction, AND, OR). 
However, the control signal, ALUControl, will select only one result out of them and return the 32-bit output, called Result. 
Besides, the ALU also records the attribute of Result, and it will be shown by the ALUFlags. ALUFlags[0] represents overflow, ALUFlags[1] represents carryout, ALUFlags[2] represents zero, and ALUFlags[3] represents negative.

I create a test vector file, as seen in Table 1, and read the test vector file into the testbench by using readmemh.

Task #2

I run ModelSim on the ALU. It shows three inputs (a, b, and ALUControl) and two outputs (Result and ALUFlags), as seen in Figure 2.

The inputs are based on the table given in the Lab1 document, all values in the waveform are displayed in hexadecimal. 
ALU takes inputs, a and b, to compute addition, subtraction, AND, and OR, and ALUControl selects one of them to the Result. 
The ALUFlags shows the attribute of Result. Finally, the waveform reflects the results that I expect in Table 1.
